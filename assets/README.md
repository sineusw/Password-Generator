# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

This is week 3's homework. In this homework the goal of this assignment was to make a functioning password generator by having a few options into generating such password. Such as the length of the password being 8-128 characters long. Along with the option of choosing to add upper and or lowercase letters, numbers, special characters, and numbers. Finding the correct code was exceptionally tough because of the new knowledge obtained about JavaScript.
